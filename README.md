# linear-regression-gradient-descent
This project is an exercise in implementating a linear regression model from scratch using gradient descent, and evaluating its performance on both synthetic and real datasets.

The notebook (`linear-regression.ipynb`) contains all code, plots, and results.
To run locally, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and open the notebook in Jupyter.
